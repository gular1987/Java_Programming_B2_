            Data Structure: a way to handle / group multiple data

                1)Array:    store data that has similar data types, but the size is fixed. / built in fracture not object?!

                2)Collection:  different types that handle and manipulate data differently.

                *Collection Framework:
                    - A group of interfaces and classes that define how the individual Collection will work.
                        (How data structure will handle data)
                    -All collection can only hold object types, not primitives (but we can wrap it and use it)

                Main interfaces of Collection Framework:
                    -Collection: the parent of all Collection types: It defines the main actions of collection.
                        Ex: add, remove, size
                    -List:  Ordered (has index), allows duplicates.
                    -Set:   Unordered (does not have index), not allow duplicates.

                *IQ:  What is the difference between Collection and Collections?
                    Collection is the interface that all Collection objects (classes that implements) implement.
                    Collections is a utility class, that has some useful methods that work with collection objects.
                        -this is not a part of the Collection framework. (frequncy( ), max( ), min( ))

                        We also used Arrays class -- utility class for array objects.
